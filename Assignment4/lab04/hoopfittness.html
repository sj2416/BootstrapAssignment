                Everyone from Zooey Deschanel to First Lady Michelle Obama is hot for Hula-Hooping. To get in the swing, too, try our exhilarating Hula-Hoop workout from Gabriella Redding, CEO and creator of Hoopnotica, a Los Angeles–based company that offers hooping classes, plus sells hoops and how-to DVDs.

                        <div class="thumbnail">
                            <img src="./images/7.jpg" alt="7">
                            <div class="caption">
                                <h5>Aim for one that's at least 40 inches in diameter and weighs 1 to 2 pounds</h5>
                            </div>
                        </div>

            <p>
                Start with the basic moves until you feel comfortable, then step up to more advanced ones, mixing and matching for your own personal head-to-toe tone-up. Do any combination of moves for 30 minutes (you'll burn 150 to 250 calories per workout) three times a week for four weeks and you’ll lose 3 to 6 inches all over your body. Yep, belly included!

            <h3>Forward Stance</h3>
            <p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                        <div class="thumbnail">
                            <img src="./images/8.jpg" alt="8">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                Stand inside the hoop with your right foot forward, holding the hoop against your lower back. Keeping your pelvis tucked, shoulders squared, and chest lifted, bend your knees slightly and give the hoop a good counterclockwise spin around your waist, making sure it's level. (If this feels awkward, try putting your left foot forward and spinning the hoop clockwise.) 
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep the hoop moving, shift your weight quickly between your front and back legs, moving your hips backward (A) and forward (B). If you feel the hoop beginning to drop, stand up straighter and push the front of your hip into the hoop as it comes around.
            </p>
            <h3>Side Stance</h3>
            <p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                        <div class="thumbnail">
                            <img src="./images/9.jpg" alt="9">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                Stand with your feet a bit wider than shoulder-width apart and parallel to each other. Give the hoop a good spin, and rock your hips from side to side so the hoop hits on the sides of your waist. Make sure your abs are tight, with chest and head lifted. The more power you put into each push, the faster the hoop will go.
            </p>
            <h3>360 Spin</h3>
            <p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
                        <div class="thumbnail">
                            <img src="./images/10.jpg" alt="10">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                First, try this without your hoop: With your left foot planted firmly, step right foot forward. Spin your body to the left, swinging right foot around a full 360° (or as close as you can) before putting it down again. (Your left foot acts as the axis of your turn.) 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you get it, grab your hoop. Begin in Forward Stance position; give the hoop a counterclockwise spin. When it's spinning parallel to the ground, support your weight on your left foot and use your right foot to power your spin; the momentum of the hoop should carry you around. Get right back into Forward Stance once you complete turn. (If this doesn't feel comfortable, try the opposite foot and direction.)
